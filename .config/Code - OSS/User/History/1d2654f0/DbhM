[general]

# Smoothing mode. Can be 'normal', 'scientific' or 'waves'. DEPRECATED as of 0.6.0
mode = normal

# Accepts only non-negative values.
framerate = 120

# 'autosens' will attempt to decrease sensitivity if the bars peak. 1 = on, 0 = off
# new as of 0.6.0 autosens of low values (dynamic range)
# 'overshoot' allows bars to overshoot (in % of terminal height) without initiating autosens. DEPRECATED as of 0.6.0
; autosens = 1
overshoot = 10

# Manual sensitivity in %. If autosens is enabled, this will only be the initial value.
# 200 means double height. Accepts only non-negative values.

# Bars' width and space between bars in number of characters.

# For SDL width and space between bars is in pixels, defaults are:

[output]

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
# 'mono_option' set mono to either take input from 'left', 'right' or 'average'.
# set 'reverse' to 1 to display frequencies the other way around.
channels = mono

; reverse = 0


[color]

# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors are supported,
# background must also be defined in hex or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off.
# You can define as many as 8 different colors. They range from bottom to top of screen

[smoothing]

# Noise reduction, float 0 - 1. default 0.77
# the raw visualization is very noisy, this factor adjusts the integral and gravity filters to keep the signal smooth
# 1 will be very slow and smooth, 0 will be fast but noisy.
